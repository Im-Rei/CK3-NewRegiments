# CK3_Regiments
A collection of mods that add new regiments to Crusader Kings 3  

## 1st Regiment : The Crossbowmen  
![Thumbnail for the Crossbowmen](https://github.com/ImMorph/CK3_Regiments/blob/main/thumbnails/modified_crossbowmen.jpg?raw=true)  
  
This Regiment can be unlocked in the base game but I added it to be available earlier and with modified pros & cons.
